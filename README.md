# Spirits Guide

Spirits Guide is an AI-driven chatbot designed to assist customers of Vallee Liquor in selecting the perfect alcoholic beverages for any occasion. By asking a series of questions related to the event, budget, and personal preferences, Spirits Guide provides tailored recommendations, enhancing the shopping experience both in-store and online.

I was hired as a SE over Summer 2023, and was approved to share this to not only showcase my skills, but to help other small liquor stores!
